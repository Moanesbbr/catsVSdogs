	<h1>Classifying Cats vs Dogs with a Convolutional Neural Network </h1>
</div>


## Description âœ¨

In that project, I ran through taking raw images that had been labeled for me already and then fed them through a convolutional neural network for classification. The images were either of dog(s) or cat(s).

### Part 1 - Preprocessing

I had the data, but I couldn't exactly just stuff raw images right through my convolutional neural network. First, I needed all of the images to be the same size, and then I also probably wanted to just grayscale them. Also, the labels of "cat" and "dog" were not useful; I wanted them to be one-hot arrays. TensorFlow Fold made it easy to implement deep-learning models that operated over data of varying size and structure.

### Part 2 - The Model

This Model differentiates whether an image is of a cat or dog using Convolutional
Neural Networks.
